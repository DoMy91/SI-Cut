Structural Inconsistency Analysis for Image Foreground Extraction
(http://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~ichenlin/public/SICut/SICut.html)

The aim of this java framework is to allow the extraction of a foreground object from an image, starting from a rectangle that contains it. In summary, an inpainting image technique is used to predict the background structure within the indicated rectangle and then the inconsistencies between the predicted image and the original image are analyzed for the foreground extraction through the structural inconsistency analysis.
